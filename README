MRI Scanning was performed on a 3 Tesla Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma scanner, using a 32-channel head coil. Functional images were acquired using a T2-weighted ﻿gradient-echo planar covering the whole brain. Scanning was done using the multiband EPI sequence from Minnesota with a multiband acceleration factor of 2; 56 slices were tilted at 15° toward the AC/PC plane, TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 75°, FOV = 240 × 240 mm2, matrix size = 96 × 96 mm2, voxel size = 2.5 × 2.5 mm, slice thickness = 2.5 mm with no gap. ﻿Anatomical images for functional overlay were acquired at 3D T1- weighted magnetization prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence at high resolution: ﻿1×1×1 mm3 voxel, TR=2300 ms, TE=2.98 ms, inversion time=900 ms, flip angle=9°.

Seven participants were excluded because of their behavioral data: 3 participants (sub-28, sub-29, sub-18) were excluded due to ﻿technical faults of the acquisition system. sub-18-sess2, no mprage (_t1w) was acquired. One participant (sub-17) reported that he did not believe he played against a real opponent, and another  (sub-22) declared he did not have the motivation to engage in the PSAP game on the second day of the experiment. Two participants were defined as outliers by the interquartile range (< Q1-1.5 or > Q3+1.5) (BA787, YR572).  In addition to the seven participants excluded for behavioral reasons as detailed above, two participants (sub-9, sub-23) were excluded from the MRI analyses due to excessive head movements during the scans.
